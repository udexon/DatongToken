<h2> Single Agent Use Case #1 </h2>

Let us consider a "trivial" (in fact, not so trivial) case of a Sender A tipping Recipient B, involving a single Agent C, all living in the same country.

As described previously, Datong Token is useful when the tippee (party receiving the tip) does not have a common online payment system as Sender A, or A does not know about B's payment details, a very common situation we encounter daily on social media.

1. As described previously, A may send B a message containing the payment details (amount in local currency, e.g. Malaysian Ringgit MYR10), togetherr with A's public key APBK. This message is generated through a Datong app, and may be sent to B via private chat, or in an Instagram comment section, visible to other users, for promotional purposes -- i.e. A is a fan of B, and he (she) would like the world to know that he is tipping B with MYR10.

2. At this point, B can download a Datong app to realize the transaction.

3. B then uses the Datong app to generate encrypted text message T, contain her (his) own public key BPBK, APBK and Agent C's public key CPBK, together with original message from A.

4. Agent C receives the message from B, then uses Datong app to process the incoming message, and to produce an authorization message to be sent to A.

5. Sender A recieves the message from Agent C and authorizes the payment. 

6. C will send A his (her) online banking details.

7. A pays C via online banking system.

8. C pays B via online banking system.


### Global Impacts

Accenture reported that there are more the underbanked or unbanked persons made up _more than one third of the world's population_, and a potential of _USD 380 billion_ of revenues from this segment of population.

Much of Asia including Chinese territories (mainland China and overseas) still actively use something similar to the traditional Hawala system.

Consider the scenario described above, Sender A would deposit MYR 200 with the Agent C, who would allow him to remit up to MYR 100 using Datong Token, while earning interests from A's deposit. In addition, A may earn interests from his own deposit.

_Consultant companies like Accenture can help Datong obtain licenses to operate legally around the world, as they have the interests, expertise and infrastructure, and Datong Token is the magic potion they need to initiate the next financial revolution._
