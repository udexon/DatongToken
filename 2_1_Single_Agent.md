<h2> Single Agent Use Case #1 </h2>

Let us consider a "trivial" (in fact, not so trivial) case of a Sender A tipping Recipient B, involving a single Agent C, all living in the same country.

As described previously, Datong Token is useful when the tippee (party receiving the tip) does not have a common online payment system as Sender A, or A does not know about B's payment details, a very common situation we encounter daily on social media.

As described previously, A may send B a message containing the payment details (amount in local currency, e.g. Malaysian Ringgit MYR10), togetherr with A's public key APBK. This message is generated through a Datong app, and may be sent to B via private chat, or in an Instagram comment section, visible to other users, for promotional purposes -- i.e. A is a fan of B, and he (she) would like the world to know that he is tipping B with MYR10.
