# Datong Token

Sender A requests Recipient B's public key. A encrypts message MA (Datong payment token) and sends token to B. Recipient B decrypts message using own private key. 

Sender A must include own public key in payment token, so that Recipient B can encrypt message MB and send it to agent C.

Then agent C can send an encrypted message to Sender A, to verify payment.
