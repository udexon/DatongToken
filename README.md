# Datong Token

Datong 大同 literally means Grand Harmony or Grand Unifying Token. We envision it to be the token that would unify all tokens.

Ever since the Bretton Woods Treaty initiated the movement to abolish gold and silver bullions as primary currencies around the world, we now have numerous national currencies as well as a myraid of cryptocurrencies.

Is it possible to create a token to unify them all? The solution appears to be so simple. Mathematically speaking, when a simple solution is discovered for a difficult problem, then we are actually discovering something great.

Consider a scenario where Sender A who lives in country P wishes to send an amount X in currency K to Recipient B who lives in country Q.

Sender A requests Recipient B's public key. A encrypts message MA (Datong payment token) and sends token to B. Recipient B decrypts message using own private key. 

Sender A must include own public key in payment token, so that Recipient B can encrypt message MB and send it to Agent C, who lives in the same country Q as B.

Then Agent C can send an encrypted message to Agent D, who lives in the same country P as Sender A, to verify payment.

Once the payment chain is verified, Agent D may collect cash from Sender A physically or use the national banking system in country P to collect the payment. Agent D will pay Agent C using their own international payment method. Agent C can then pay Recipient B cash physically in person, or using the national banking system in country Q.
