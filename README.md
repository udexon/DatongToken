# Datong Token

Datong 大同 literally means Grand Harmony or Grand Unifying Token. We envision it to be the token that would unify all tokens.

Ever since the Bretton Woods Treaty initiated the movement to abolish gold and silver bullions as primary currencies around the world, we now have numerous national currencies as well as a myraid of cryptocurrencies.

Is it possible to create a token to unify them all? The solution appears to be so simple. Mathematically speaking, when a simple solution is discovered for a difficult problem, then we are actually discovering something great.

Consider a scenario where Sender A who lives in country P wishes to send an amount X in currency K to Recipient B who lives in country Q.

Sender A requests Recipient B's public key. A encrypts message MA (Datong payment token) and sends token to B. Recipient B decrypts message using own private key. 

Sender A must include own public key in payment token, so that Recipient B can encrypt message MB and send it to Agent C, who lives in the same country Q as B.

Then Agent C can send an encrypted message to Agent D, who lives in the same country P as Sender A, to verify payment.

Once the payment chain is verified, Agent D may collect cash from Sender A physically or use the national banking system in country P to collect the payment. Agent D will pay Agent C using their own international payment method. Agent C can then pay Recipient B cash physically in person, or using the national banking system in country Q.

### (Non)-Adoption of Cryptocurrencies

Datong Token immediately solves the adoption problem of cryptocurrencies. In order for a particular cryptocurrency to be useful, by definition, the sender and the recipient both have to create a personal account for the cryptocurrency concerned.

In Datong Token, the mechanisms involved in a cryptocurrency transaction are broken down to the bare minimum. In the scenario described above for payment using Datong Token, the sender and recipient do not need to create personal accounts on Datong system. 

After A sends the token to B, presumably via a mobile chat service such as WhatsApp, B will use a Datong app to process then token, then send a new token to agent C. Agent C again will use a Datong app to process the token, and send a new token to Agent D. Agent D will also use a Datong app to process the token, and send a new token to Sender A.

(We use the term "a Datong app" to imply the fact that third parties may produce apps that comply to the Datong protocols.)

All the transmissions of token can be done by sending text messages on chat apps like WhatsApp.

Finally, A will use a Datong app to verify then token from D, to confirm that D is an authorized agent who will send money via conventional means to C, and C will send money via conventional means to B. After this confirmation, A may send money to D via conventional means, to initiate the transaction. 

Now consider this variation:

-- Agent D sends money using cryptocurrency L to Agent C.

Let's illustrate the two scenarios in diagrams:

Scenario 1

We now have sufficient understanding to compare and analyse various fundamental issues concerning international financial transactions, cryptocurrencies and Datong Token.
