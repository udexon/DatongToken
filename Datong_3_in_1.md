The user identity (UID) that is most widely used in social media applications today is largely a direct descendant of the Unix user identity, primarily based on symmetric encryption, i.e. the encryption and decryption for authentication use the same key derived from the password string supplied by the user. The password file is a single file in the /etc directory in most of the Linux operating system in use today. This practice dates back to the 1970 where a large number of users accessed a central server, which ironically were much less powerful than today's Android phone. As such, radically different ways of manageing user identities could have been implemented but unfortunately bad habits die hard.

It was also during the 1970s, asymmetric encryption (encryption using public key, decryption using private key) was proposed. It is now being widely used in various applications, e.g. [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) in network connections. 

As the number of social media apps and cryptocurrencies increase, users generally finds it increasingly cumbersome to manage passwords for diffrent apps.

Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technologies have been the literal black horse in the past decade. Despite its upheavals in the past few years, Bitcoin has firmly established the viability of cryptocurrencies with about USD130 billion market capitalization. Nevertheless, the complications arising from user identity management may become a bottleneck for its continued growth.
