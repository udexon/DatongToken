### Datong Token Overview

[Datong Token Examples](https://github.com/udexon/EMYL/blob/master/E003_Online_Tipping.md) illustrates several issues concerning identity management, cryptocurrencies as well as conventional financial transactions.

Consider Scenario III where Party A sends money to Party B using Western Union in the conventional manner, via Western Union agents.

By comparing Scenarios I, II and III, we may conclude that Datong Token minimizes the costs of transactions for international money transfer, as well as enables a much greater number of people to act as money transfer agents.

This is a new area in law --- rules on tipping? Possible to control source code export? What if source code is broken down into pieces? How to enforce? 20 years problem?


- Compare Scenarios I II III -- this is high level perspective, how to link to RSA? Explore identity management?
- From the technical perspective, what are the roles of RSA in both scenarios?
- Minimizing agent fees
- (Non)-Adoption of Cryptocurrencies
- Datong app -- meaning?
- Punchline? Linux and Datong Token both being simple but has great impact?
