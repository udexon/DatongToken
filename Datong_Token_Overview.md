### Datong Token Overview

[Datong Token Examples](https://github.com/udexon/EMYL/blob/master/E003_Online_Tipping.md) illustrates several issues concerning identity management, cryptocurrencies as well as conventional financial transactions.

Consider the following scenarios.

Scenario I: Online Tipping with Datong Token via Datong Agents using Western Union <br>

Scenario II: Online Tipping with Datong Token via Datong Agents using Bitcoin Cash <br>

Scenario III: Direct Money Transfer using Western Union without Agents <br>

Describe the roles and functions of transactions, identity management and cryptography in each of Scenarios I II III IV.

A transaction is defined as the transfer of an amount in currency CP by party A in country P to the equivalent in currency CQ for party B in country Q, minus commission fees.

For now, we ignore the special cases where a legal person may own bank accounts in different countries, or a user may own more than one accounts of the same cryptocurrency.

In Scenario III (Direct Money Transfer using Western Union without Agents), identity management is carried out by the Western Union Agents and Systems (software and hardware), utilizing national identity documents and transaction code sent by Sender A to Recipient B.

In Scenario IV (Direct Money Transfer using Bitcon Cash without Agents), identity management and transaction are carried out by a series of operations described in the following document as well as other related resources:

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction

Bitcoin represents one of the most comprehensive documentation and code for financial transactions. Bitcoin Cash is a fork (variant) of Bitcoin with a larger block size and shorter transaction time.

In computerized financial transactions, the most critical aspect is identity management. Conventional implementations for identity management as shown in Scenarios III and IV have been overly complicated and cumbersome. Datong Token managed to simplify identity management as shown in examples .... 

Datong Token reconstruct concepts and protocols for messaging and transactions, resulting in a general framework for conventional financial transactions involving national currencies as well as cryptocurrencies.

In Datong Token, steps in messaging and transactions are broken down to bare minimum and reconstructed from the ground up, allowing it interface with a wide range of systems, from conventional financial transactions to cryptocurrencies. 

While blockchain has inspired many novel ideas and projects, most have not been successfully deployed or gained popularity due to various factors. Besides the fundamental breakthrough in Datong Token in removing user registration while enabling authentication, Phos stack machine shell (Smashlet) enables  better software engineering practices and easier learning, by providing (yet another) homoiconic upstream downstream interface (YAHUDI), where the upstream host programming language is translated to downstream stack machine shell programming language. Thus we believe Phos is able to consolidate programmer communities segemented by programming languages and make learning of programming easier using one universal script derived from Forth like Reverse Polish Notation. We hope this shall recruit more people to collaborate in Datong Token, overcoming the obstacles faced by other blockchain projects.

Explain: how to develop network of agents.

By comparing Scenarios I, II and III, we may conclude that Datong Token minimizes the costs of transactions for international money transfer, as well as enables a much greater number of people to act as money transfer agents.

This is a new area in law --- rules on tipping? Possible to control source code export? What if source code is broken down into pieces? How to enforce? 20 years problem?


- Compare Scenarios I II III -- this is high level perspective, how to link to RSA? Explore identity management?
- From the technical perspective, what are the roles of RSA in both scenarios?
- Minimizing agent fees
- (Non)-Adoption of Cryptocurrencies
- Datong app -- meaning?
- Punchline? Linux and Datong Token both being simple but has great impact?

Transaction: 
- --( is a high level function of )--> Identity Management
- --( is a high level function of )--> Cryptography

Start with DT applied to face to face payments and Western Union. Describe its abstract significance.

Redefine user identity, money, national supervision, person vs. government rights, banking system, financial institution etc.






Let us attempt to describe a generalized model for Scenarios I to IV.
